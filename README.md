#   NBA Stats Go
NBA Stats Go is our (David Liu and Jorge Raad) final project for ECE 564. The idea for this app came from our mutual interest in basketball and the NBA. The app allows users to search and view stats on NBA players, compare stats between players, and search for instances of an interesting stat line or career high.
